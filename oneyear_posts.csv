"Alpha Stim, chronic pain, and anxiety",1,qdcqbj,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/qdcqbj/alpha_stim_chronic_pain_and_anxiety/,5,"I have questions for others who have tried using the Alpha Stim for pain relief. I also have questions related to anxiety. 

Did it/does it help your pain?

How long did it take you to feel improvement?

Did it/does it increase your anxiety?

If so, did you have to adjust any meds you were on?

I’ve started using mine for chronic back pain, and haven’t really felt any relief. It’s been about two months. 

I’ll use the 4 electrodes, set the machine to its highest setting, and go about my day. I don’t mind wearing it, so sometimes it’ll be on for 10+ hours. 

Then I’d usually do an ear-clip session afterwards. I can’t handle that one very high, only about a 1. Otherwise I’m nauseous, seasick and have a headache. 

I’ve noticed a huge increase in anxiety. 

My naturopath says that if you have trauma (oh boy do I ever- it’s being treated with EMDR and I’ve had a lot of success) that it’ll be like peeling an onion- trauma and feelings will come up while using it. And that if your anxiety increases, you probably have too much medication in your system. 

So, WTF do I do? I feel like the Alpha Stim has shown me a Costco sized warehouse of shitty feelings I’ve crammed into my body over the last 40 years that need to be let out and I’m very overwhelmed. And still in pain. 

My anxiety was so well controlled with my SSRI up until now. Do I go off of it? That’s a serious undertaking. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist in a few weeks and I’ll be asking her. 

If this is what Alpha Stim is like while taking an SSRI I might not be able to handle it. 

I just really really really don’t want to be in such constant pain. I also REALLY don’t want to take opiates. 

I can’t get my pain dr to take me seriously. My ortho won’t take me seriously until the pain dr does. I’ve done PT, and it made it SO MUCH WORSE. I have some MRI’s waiting to get approved but I’m guessing they won’t help much. 

I know this is probably trapped trauma in my body. Another reason Alpha Stim is a good choice for this particular pain. But I can’t function like this.",1634892803.0,2021-10-22 04:53:23
Do you want to stop stuttering : this might help !,16,qcqanv,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/qcqanv/do_you_want_to_stop_stuttering_this_might_help/,7,"# I've seen a couple studies so far that look at the effects of tdcs on stuttering, I thought I would post them here.

**1)** Transcranial direct current stimulation over left inferior frontal cortex improves speech fluency in adults who stutter: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6019054/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6019054/)

This study used **1ma for 20 minutes, anode over the left inferior frontal cortex FC5 and the cathode on the right supraorbital area**, while people did **choral and metronome-timed speech** (this was done for **5 days** and resulted in significant improvement in speech fluency compared to the group that just did the vocal training alone).

**2)** The Effectiveness of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on the Anxiety and Severity of Stuttering in Adolescents Aged 15 to 18: [http://jrrs.mui.ac.ir/index.php/jrrs/article/view/3605](http://jrrs.mui.ac.ir/index.php/jrrs/article/view/3605)

**2ma 20 minutes anode between F7 and FC5 and cathode between F8 and FC6** (in the article they wrote anterior temporal lobe, but not the location), for 10 sessions.

Results show a decrease in anxiety and in stuttering in the tdcs group.

**3)** The Effectiveness of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on Improving the Severity of Stuttering and Anxiety in School-aged Children Who Stutter: [https://jpcp.uswr.ac.ir/article-1-747-en.pdf](https://jpcp.uswr.ac.ir/article-1-747-en.pdf)

**1ma 20 minutes, anode F7** (left inferior frontal cortex), **cathode FP2** (right supraorbital) in **15 consecutive daily sessions**.

There was a decrease in stutter and in anxiety that was maintained at the follow up 6 weeks later.

**4)** Investigation of the effect of Delayed Auditory Feedback and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (DAF-tDCS) treatment for the enhancement of speech fluency in adults who stutter: a Randomized Controlled Trial: [https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-29391/v2/943060ea-c7e5-4202-b13a-cd9a6781fffb.pdf?c=1634299998](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-29391/v2/943060ea-c7e5-4202-b13a-cd9a6781fffb.pdf?c=1634299998)

**1ma 20 minutes, anode T3, cathode FP2** (right supraorbital) for **6 sessions** while doing DAF.

There was a reduction in the Stuttering Severity Instrument in the group that did the tdcs+DAF but not the group that just did the DAF. This effect persisted for the follow up 6 weeks later.

**5)** Online cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation to the right homologue of Broca's area improves speech fluency in people who stutter: [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pcn.12796](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pcn.12796)

**2ma 200 seconds, cathode between F8 and FC6** (between the temple and the ear), and anode left supraorbital improved speech fluency.

# 

Note that a lot of of the studies used 1ma and not 2ma, which is probably because the skulls of children are smaller and so, smaller currents are used. If you are an adult 2ma would probably be more effective.

Also, some montages also decreased anxiety, but it is not clear wether it is the montage in itself that has an anxiolytic effect or if people are less anxious because they stutter less.

In general, language is lateralized to the left part of the brain so that's where you want to put the anode. Two main areas are important for language production and processing (the Broca area, F7 or F5, and the Wernicke area CP5), and when stimulated they tend to increase verbal ability and fluency. The ideal is to speak during the stimulation to enhance the effects.

The cathode is often put on the right supraorbital, it might be more interesting to put it on F8 (the homologue of Broca's area but on the right side), since doing that in itself improves verbal fluency.

Now, I am a neuroscience researcher in the field of tDCS, tACS and TMS for the better part of 10 years now, so I would put myself into category 1. So, I was thinking about starting a YouTube channel, where we could discuss the research behind brain stimulation. Regular live discussions, Q n A's, and more lecture type streams on various topics related to brain stim research. But I would only do that if there is some interest. If y'all think: piss off with your research, I wouldn't do it :P

So, if you like, answer the following question. Do you base your session more on research or self-experimentation and would you be interested in a YT channel on tDCS/tACS research?

New montage to increase creativity: tDCS of the Generation-Related Posterior Temporal Lobe and the Executive Control-Related Prefrontal Cortex,9,qc1fab,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/qc1fab/new_montage_to_increase_creativity_tdcs_of_the/,11,"[https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhab261/6347937](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhab261/6347937)

Abstract:

Creativity is generally defined as the ability to generate innovative thoughts that are both original and valuable. Previous studies have suggested that the temporal lobe, related to memory extraction and construction, is responsible for generating creative ideas and that the executive system supports the generation of creative ideas. However, the causal relationships between these structures and the novelty index as well as the appropriateness index of generated ideas have not been revealed. It is still largely unknown where and how original and valuable ideas are generated. In this study, the transcranial direct current stimulation technique was used to selectively manipulate the activity of the generation-related right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) (experiment 1) and the executive control-related left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (experiment 2). Then, both the novelty and appropriateness indexes of generated ideas were analyzed during insight problem-solving. The results showed that anodal stimulation of the right TPJ increased both the novelty and appropriateness indexes of creative ideas, whereas anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC increased the novelty index but not the appropriateness index of creative ideas. These findings suggest that the posterior temporal lobe takes both the novelty and appropriateness attributes into account to generate ideas, while the executive control system can effectively regulate the novelty attribute of generated ideas but ineffectively addresses the inappropriateness attribute. The current study indicates complementary mechanisms in the process of generating original and valuable ideas.",1634738078.0,2021-10-20 09:54:38

tDCS vs TMS vs ?? for Brain Fog— newbie question!,3,q9l5bf,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/q9l5bf/tdcs_vs_tms_vs_for_brain_fog_newbie_question/,9,"Hi all! I posted in r/rTMS and r/BrainFog similar questions, but upon discovery of tDCS I saw there’s a much larger community here. I’m strongly considering starting a round of TMS, but have recently been spooked by possible side effects that aren’t mentioned in the general marketing of the treatment. Ive heard good things about tDCS, but how does it really compare in terms of efficacy and safety?

I’ve been diagnosed with depression, although personally I think 15 years of brain fog with no answers *led* to depression, not the other way around. But I also feel like I gave it an honest shot at treatment after years of therapy and various medications. It really does feel like if I could just give my brain a massage then this would all go away. But it sounds like this stuff is still largely experimental?

1) In your opinion which is the most effective? Which has the most research showing efficacy? A tDCS device, Flow, targets F3 and F4 even though the Bumblebee manual says that F3 and FP2 is the most researched montage.

2) How many times per week should I undergo the Bumblebee treatment? And at what intensity? The device starts at 1 mA and goes to 6 mA. However, numbers 2 - 5 are not shown and I have to guess where they are. I understand that the recommended session duration is 20 minutes.

"Have any of you experienced with longer/ more intense sessions, and what effects did you experience (I'll go first) ?",5,q12fal,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/q12fal/have_any_of_you_experienced_with_longer_more/,12,"I recently saw that to enhance the effects of tdcs you could stimulate an area for 20 minutes, wait 20 minutes and then stimulate it again for 20 minutes.

I thought I would try that, but instead of waiting 20 minutes I would use that time to stimulate another region :)

Since I want to improve my general cognition, executive function (and to a lesser extend my emotional regulation), I targeted the dlpfc.

\->20 minutes of 2 ma anode F3, cathode on the shoulder

\->20 minutes of 2 ma anode F4, cathode on the shoulder

\->20 minutes of 2 ma anode F3, cathode on the shoulder

\->20 minutes of 2 ma anode F4, cathode on the shoulder

In total the stimulation lasted for 1 hour and 20 minutes.

Tdcs is not very effective immediately, especially after only one session, so the placebo effect cannot be excluded. But anyways here is my experience:

1)I was very clear headed and alert. I typically have some form of inattentiveness so being able to focus for once was a relief. I was ""here"".

2)I was more productive. When I wanted to do something (I am learning mathematics) I was able to do it for much longer without feeling an urge to watch some youtube.

3)Even though I was more alert I was also paradoxically calmer.

4)I felt motivated.

5)My sleep was worse. I had a harder time falling asleep and staying asleep.

These effects persisted up to one day later.

All of these effects resemble that of stimulant medication like methylphenidate or adderall.

&#x200B;

My friend, who was depressed last year used tdcs to get better (he only did a couple sessions and told me that it didn't do anything, looking back now he tells me that he was more active, concentrated during the week he used the tdcs but that the effect was subtle and that he only noticed it when it faded away).

Anyways he also did long tdcs sessions (up to 1 hour and 30 minutes at once, F3+ F4-) and he always reported feeling very tired after these sessions, but also that the day after he felt better.

Side effects of tACS stimulation?,2,q00748,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/q00748/side_effects_of_tacs_stimulation/,13,"Hi,

It' been a couple of weeks since I started to use the NeuroMyst device to try tACS instead of tDCS (I own a Brain Driver as well). I started off with several tDCS sessions at +Fp1/-Oz, 20 minutes, 2mA for depression, anxiety and anhedonia with the Brain Driver. Felt a bit of relief but nothing spectacular. Aside of a bit more of calmness and energy, I felt something like a heaviness in the forehead area, right above the eyebrows after training. Did 5 sessions, took 2 days off, restarted and felt like it was the first one. The heaviness feeling cleared up when I stopped training.

So I decided to switch to tACS with the NeuroMyst, doing F3/Fp2. Chose 2 mA for 20 minutes with a 9Hz frequency. After the first session, the heaviness feeling returned in the same area. So for the next 3-4 sessions I lowered the current to 1.5, 1 and finally 0.5 mA. No noticeable improvements as well, aside of feeling a bit more anxious and with a clump /heartburn like sensation in the pit of the stomach after training. Took a day off to rest.

The weird thing is after tACS my sleep quality improved somehow (I was able to sleep through the night without waking up) but the feeling of heaviness is still there even after stopping for a day. It is not uncomfortable but it is a bit annoying. Some other effects are a mild difficulty to recall words and the return of poor sleep quality when not training. I feel that my eyesight is a tad worse, I suspect because the stimulation in the forehead area.

So several questions: How long should one rest after doing 4-5 sessions of tACS/tACS? Are the effects permanent? And if so, is there a way to revert them somehow? I'm aware that everybody's brain is different, but has anyone experienced something similar when training?

I suppose the montages I chose are not the best for me, so the plan now is to stop training for a few days and restart with another protocol / montage to improve sleep quality and anxiety, not located in the forehead (something like F7/F8, Delta, 20 min, 0.5 mA). Any suggestions / comments are most welcome. Thanks!",1633197970.0,2021-10-02 14:06:10

tDCS montage update!,1,pnobhh,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/pnobhh/tdcs_montage_update/,7,"Further along the testing path, I think I've found a general purpose tDCS montage that should carry pretty well although it's a tiny bit tricky.

This is a modification of the cerebellar montage I proposed earlier.

The complication in this montage is that you will need to switch the polarity of the electrodes after 5-7 minutes. 

Montage starts with the cathode (black) placed at the base of your skull where it meets the neck.  You should be aiming the center of electrode for your neck just below the skull.  The anode can be placed realistically anywhere, however over one of the association cortexes seems to produce the most ""pleasant"" results, especially when right over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.  The 10-10 placement for these is the anode at roughly F3, the cathode about an inch below I(z) or inion center.  For the first time I usually start people by ramping to 3.5mA. 

After 5-7 minutes, swap the anode and cathode.  The cathode can be placed anywhere really, but roughly around F4 seems to ""feel"" good to others. Otherwise F3 is good.  With this positioning give it another 15-20 minutes.

Everyone I've tested this on has shown noticeable performance gains during stimulation when working on the whole test suite (which is super encouraging), and performance gains scale with current.  I've tested this on myself to 7mA and others up to 6mA, the primary concern being resistance burns/irritation.

I have not been on these for all years but go on and off in cycles. 
I know these drugs has taking a toll on my brain. I feel my memory is not like before, executive functions not as strong and don't feel... sharp and intelligent which is the ""real me"".

There has never been any solutions from doctors perspective. It is what it is. So this is me experimenting to see if it can help me.

Both of the above also seem to dramatically reduce the amount of sleep I need. I usually am a heavy sleeper (11 hours a night) and tdcs generally cuts that requirement in half.

I have a CES device that I bought to help relieve my anxiety. So far, no good. 

When I use the unit (sponge-clips to ear lobes) they have a mild zapping sensation. I can't ""dial down"" the unit any lower. (It's at 1 of 6). I understand it should be just sub perceptual for efficacy. 

I've tried a few conductive substances, and the best so far has been contact lens saline solution. But it's not enough. 

I'd really like this to work as building my vagus tone seems the last step in a very long health journey. 

I'd be quite grateful for ideas. Thanks!

EDIT: This thread can be summarised as : ""ATANG and YJT CES machines are not worth buying. At least for me."" 


FYI

- The clips have sponge on one side and none on the other.

- This is a ""cheap Chinese"" product found on Amazon. I'm more thinking it's the sponge than the device. 

- I didn't try electrode Gel yet as it's not easy to find; delivery will take 10 days (!)

- I have noticed effects on my system, but stimulating not relaxing. Which is an ok start; at least it's seemingly effecting vagus (or whatever). Direction of effect can be tweaked, I'm sure.

I would like to continue with TDCS.

However, I noticed that I have given myself some scalp burns both times I have done the depression montage. The burns don’t appear to be on my forehead but only on the scalp. 

I am using the Apex 2 mA device with sponge electrodes for 20 min sessions at 2 mA.

The first time, I was using 0.9% saline solution, but I felt that it was too painful so I stopped.

This time I cut the 0.9% saline with tap water in a 2:1 ratio. I felt some pain as I was turning up the device at the session was start, but then I only felt itching during the rest of the session, and then felt some pain as I was turning down the device at the session end. I noticed that I had the same red bumps in my hair and now it feels like scabs, as before.

How do I do TDCS without burning my scalp? 

From one article I read, I’m not sure if my electrodes were wet enough. How wet should they be?

How do you guys make your saline?

With my tDCS circuit and tDCS devices, most people start reporting round 3mA, and stop around 4.5mA.  All are using cellulose electrodes.

On the flip side, there's a lot more sub threshold feel to tACS, even under 2mA I've gotten consistent reports of vibrating or pulsing, usually around the frequency of the stimulation, even fully grounded.  tDCS also seems to have a stronger effect.

She’s recommended either the Brain Premier or the ActivaDose as being the most reliable in her experience.

My problem is, Caputron can’t say for sure whether the electrodes for either contain latex (natural rubber) which I’m severely allergic to.  The Brain Premier listing says it’s got “rubber” electrodes, but not all rubber is natural rubber (latex) — if it’s vulcanised, it’s relatively safe.  Still, I’m sadly inclined not to chance that one.

The ActivaDose lists “carbon rubber” electrodes, & I have no idea what that means.  It might refer to vulcanised rubber…or it might not.  Does anyone have any idea on this?

Caputron has recommended I use the ElectroSquare electrodes (https://caputron.com/products/electrosquare-tdcs-electrodes) as they’re listed specifically as silicone & no latex.

Montage Test Volunteers Needed,2,obua5k,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/obua5k/montage_test_volunteers_needed/,22,"Hey everyone.  I'd like to test out a couple of new montages that seem promising on paper, but I need more data.

This montage should be run for at least one week, alternating days, and for at least 15 minutes per session.  tDCS (sorry don't have tACS settings for the specific circuits I'm looking at yet) only at this time.

The cathode should be placed roughly one inch/25 mm below the [inion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_occipital_protuberance), or ridge on the very back center of your skull.  The spot should be exactly where the bottom of the skull meets the neck itself, dead center.

The anode should be placed preferably about 1/4""/7 mm  to the left of FP1 in the [10-20 system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%E2%80%9320_system_(EEG)).  At currents above 4ma this may freak out your optic nerve, but it should quickly adjust.  If this isn't tolerable, F3 and F7 are okayish as well.

Current strength should be at least 3ma, preferably 4 or 5ma.

Please let me know what your general experience was, if you noticed any effect after running the montage, and if you had any change on cognitive tests particularly the [frame and line](http://www.labinthewild.org/studies/frame-line/).

Thanks for your feedback!

Edit:  There's a few other montage placement points that seem promising using this cathode placement.  Anode placement cycling between T5 and F7 seems like it should show noticeable effect in all but the most thick headed, an Cz/Fz anode placement seems very promising.

Edit 2:  [Individual Cerebral Blood Flow Responses to Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation at Various Intensities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7697831/)

Edit 3:  During the course of the montage it would be good if we had a standardized set of cognitive tests that should be accessible to everyone.  I think the any three tests (your choice) on [testmybrain.org](https://testmybrain.org) which is sponsored by [manybrains.net](https://manybrains.net), who's board of directors is kind of an all-star team in brain research.  The test should be taken every day, even when not admistering tDCS, at roughly the same time.  Try to screenshot the results pages for your own reference when sharing results.  The important feature of these tests is to measure changes, not so much their ability to correctly determine function so please don't internalize the results.

Edit 4: Some may find a significant result with as few as two sessions of the reverse positioning (anode 1"" below inion).  Apparently there was a significant change in clarity of thought/brain fog assumed symptomatic of depressive disorders.  Nothing previously had worked so I thought I'd pass that along since it's encouraging.

tl;dr: Cathode 1"" below Inion, Anode near your left eye, 4mA, every other day for two weeks (but report in after first week).  Do cognitive test every day during two week period.",1625170780.0,2021-07-01 16:19:40

My problem isn't that I have negative emotions, it's more that I don't really feel much emotions or any pleasure, which is what I'm trying to obtain. It was something I had prior to depression.

I think I will continue to stick with the standard +F3/-Fp2 montage for a few weeks if it isn't noticeably negatively affecting me, which is hard for me to really say because I've already been feeling so anhedonic and apathetic.

But I was just curious if there are any other montages outside the traditional ones that people have experimented with in regards to anhedonia and apathy and have noticed results.",1623812897.0,2021-06-15 23:08:17

I am selling a tDCS device by TCT Research (clinical version).

I paid $529 and I am selling it for $395 + shipping in the contental U.S.

"Just some questions, hoping to get some answers",3,nyicmk,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/nyicmk/just_some_questions_hoping_to_get_some_answers/,11,"Hey guys. So I've just did my first tDCS session with the Apex Device using the +F3/-Fp2 montage with some 0.9% sodium chloride irrigation solution. During the stimulation, I just put on a 20 minute guided meditation but I noticed it was very hard for me to visualize and really connect with it. Normally, even outside of stimulation, I find it hard to visualize and feel anything anyways (due to anhedonia), but I was wondering if this is normal with tDCS. I also felt some tingle at first around the anode part, kinda felt like a slight burn which I eventually got used to.

After the session, I noticed some marks on my right forehead (the Fp2) and I'm kinda worried. Does it go away? There seems to be an outline of the square electrode and slight marking of the sponge which have seem to clear up a little bit more afterwards. It's only been like 20 minutes I've took it off so I might just be freaking out but it's definitely unappealing.

I'm also wondering how do I maintain the electrodes and stuff afterwards? The Apex channel on YouTube says to just put the electrodes away and reapply a small amount of saline solution for the next session -- and rinsing it after 5-7 sessions.

And again, I'm wondering about the burn marks. Giving +F3/-F4 might be more appealing now since it wouldn't be as visible as a mark on my forehead. Was wondering what's an ideal amount of sessions before deciding to go for another one, or if it's fine for one to just try a different montage a day before deciding on one to start off and stick with.

Also wondering how long did it take for you guys who have seen benefits to actually see the benefits?",1623536777.0,2021-06-12 18:26:17

I didn't start to do tDCS sessions yet because, firstly, I would like to know your opinion about:

1. What would be the best montage or montages for me?
2. How frequently should I use it or them?

I plan to use three or two montages:

1. F10 anode / left arm cathode (montage 1) at morning.
2. Fp1 anode / right arm cathode (montage 2) at noon.
3. P3 anode / P4 cathode (montage 3) at evening.

Do montages 1 and 2 conflict with each other?  
Should I use them (the 3 montages) the same day or alternate (every days or months or years) or should I jsut focus on one of them (for the rest of my life)?

2 week depression scores were improved significantly. By 4 weeks the effect had subsided, possibly due to the fact that TACS was only administered for 5 days.

So I've followed the instructions on the manual that it came with, but the problem I have is the analog meter moves when the red cable is plugged into both of the orifices in the front, but when I do the black and red cable plugged into their respective slots, the analog meter does not move at all after turning it on.

I'm wondering would this also be a bad thing to try to do. Would it wear out the electrodes because there is no saline on them? Are there actually electrical currents being flown into the electrodes or unlikely due it not having any saline? I really can't tell with the analog meter not moving.

Anecdotal report of several montages with Apex Type A 18V 4ma device over the course of two weeks.,6,n9xr0x,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/n9xr0x/anecdotal_report_of_several_montages_with_apex/,13,"I have been using this for almost two weeks now and I have received mixed results. Given the benefit of some montages, however, I will keep using this device and see what long-term outcomes I have. 

I purchased the 4ma device as a stronger alternative to 2ma, although it is my first device ever that I have purchased. The reason I bought this particular brand is because of safety. 

The Apex device has sponge connectors instead of the regular electrode ones. It minimizes skin burning and is easy to set up. Just make some saline with some non-iodized salt and pour it on both sponges. 

The device is also strictly battery powered, requiring the use of 2 9V batteries. The device also has an analog connection so the meter should always show you exactly how much current you are introducing. That being said, the anodal connector tends to corrode much faster than the cathodal one, which requires routine cleaning depending on how much you use it. Pretty easy to set up overall. 

The device itself is totally safe, as I have experimented with using it twice a day for 30 minutes per session and have little to no side effects. It takes 10ma current to kill you and 4ma is well below the threshold where you would be injured by the electric current. 

When I do feel side effects it really depends on the montage. Sometimes I have a mild headache, sometimes I feel dizzy, sometimes I get a tick and in one instance I actually felt nauseous but that's because I placed the anodal connector on the wrong part.

In my experience you need to pay close attention to where exactly you are placing the connectors as you may accidentally stimulate other parts of the brain and get different results and side effects.

Now let's move on to the montages listed here: https://apexdevice.net/

- Depression/anxiety, insomnia montage: This was my first montage and it was the reason why I purchased this device. I say it definitely works. It works *too* well, actually since I get transported in this state of bliss for several hours where I turn into a Buddha-like mentality where I feel like living in harmony with people, etc. I would feel totally relaxed, sleep better and live in the moment. It does make me kinda lazy, however since I would get so laid back.

I also need to use the device twice a day to make sure the effects last all day, several hours apart, although I have experimented with 20 minutes apart instead but several hours apart is good enough. I was under the impression that this would cause long-term potentiation and provide a permanent change to my mood but it has only proven to be temporary so far so I have moved on to other montages out of curiosity.

Junk food/Alcohol Cravings montage - No immediate effect although the intention was to use it for porn addiction, not food and alcohol. I had assumed the same pathways for food and alcohol cravings would be triggered under porn addiction but that may not seem to be the case. However I won't explore it further because it seems like a waste of time.

- Insightfulness/Creativity - No effect at all.

- Accelerated learning - This works for a few hours although I've only done it once. There is definitely increased focus on a given task but it feels like you're on adderall. You would have to do two sessions spread over several hours apart to have an all-day effect.

- Focus - This one had the most impact although I only started doing it yesterday. This removed the usual sluggishness I have and I got stuff done big time. I work from home but it is slow so I decided to make multiple phone calls and arrangements in anticipation of my address change next month and on top of that I actually cleaned the toilet, which is something I am too lazy to do. Now it is spotless. 

I also completed my phone calls at work with a lot more insight and focus and a more well-rounded resolution in each and every call so I became much more productive overall.

Then I tested things out further by playing Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones. Amazing game, btw. Yesterday I thoroughly plotted out each move with utmost focus and caution, examining the pros and cons of each decision and planning all the way to the end in each chapter and carefully deciding what role each of my unit plays, down to the very details of my unit's stats vs the enemy's stats, how much damage is acceptable to take in order to complete my objectives, and what are the odds of success in each maneuver. 

I was amazed at how I would keep all of my units united and carefully advanced their positions on the map. Then when I went to sleep I was hooked, thinking of alternative strategies to devise in my sleep. Man I was hooked. 

In conclusion: The device works for some montages but not others but it is safe. I will continue to try different montages over time, such as the socialization montage, but don't expect this to be a magic pill that will solve all your mental problems. You still have to keep carefully applying this device every day.",1620741877.0,2021-05-11 10:04:37

Treatment:
Initially, I did get some very mild relief from depression and anxiety, but this was short lived

Poor Software:
- You can only use Flow, via the app and the app will only allow you to use it a certain times - madness
- The app is poor, patronising and the automated ""A.I."" questions are often not relevant and can be infuriating 

Cheap Hardware:
- This thing is so cheaply made and poor quality, Iwould be amazed if it lasts a year
- You can't position the electrodes, they are in Fixed position 
- You have to keep purchasing their expensive pads (although in the end I started making my own)

Unethical:
- I also have concerns that Flow is unethical
They have clearly invested a lot of money into marketing the product rather than engineering it. For example If you try Googling 'tDCS' or 'brain stimulation' or try searching for another brand you always get 'Flow' as the top results, they would have to pay a lot of money for that honor

tDCS vs tACS: what's your experience,6,mydfym,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/mydfym/tdcs_vs_tacs_whats_your_experience/,4,"I have experimented with both and I am curious how many of you guys have done the same and your experiences. I am now designing my new tACS and tDCS capable device with a couple other features as well. This is a project I am revisiting that I haven't touched in 5+ years. I have learned much about electrical engineering and embedded engineering since then so this project will hopefully be a dramatic improvement. I'll start with my experience:

I started with a 5V device using the traditional voltage regulator from a 9V battery approach. I quickly wanted to learn more about this tech after doing so. My theory behind my next experiment; a tDCS device is that our brain works on frequencies (brain waves) not so much direct currents. I made a tACS device that ran on 15 volts from a wall power adapter. This thing was dangerous and ghetto. It ran off an arduino to get the PWM, driving a mosfet with no voltage regulation whatsoever. I could adjust the voltage from 0 to 15v with a simple potentiometer. I bought a hardhat helmet and drilled a bunch of holes in it and placed a bunch of bolts in it. I could screw the bolts in or out to make the perfect contact needed for each sponge that was glued to the bolts. This worked pretty well but had to make sure the positioning was OK or the bolts would kinda zap you lol. I never got any burns but surely some zappy feels. It's much more obvious when you are getting zapped by AC than dc as it pulses. I had another potentiometer attached to the ADC of the Arduino that controlled the frequency of the PWM, so I could adjust it from a fast to slow frequency. This design was before I understood what a full bridge mosfet circuit was so it was only AC going in one direction as I was just using one mosfet. 

It was so long ago that I was using this thing that I have trouble recalling if I helped me out or not, but I'm pretty sure it did or I wouldn't have put so much effort into improving it. The main purpose of it was to boost cognitive function and it seemed to accomplish that. I haven't felt quite as sharp ever since. This is why I am revisiting this project with my newfound EE knowledge. The new device will used a full AC wave and filter the PWM signals from the mosfets. I may also integrate current regulation. If not, I will set each PWM channel with a simple voltage divider as I did before. I still haven't decided on the microcontroller I will use or if I will use two or more as I want to use a dev board that has and SD card for logging data and a screen that I can use for function settings.

Anyways, would love to hear from people who have tried both, or specifically tACS. There are tons of people who have tried tDCS but tACS seems to be much more uncommon.",1619372914.0,2021-04-25 13:48:34
"Looking for recs re: anxiety, panic disorder, ADHD-PI",3,mxxcy4,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/mxxcy4/looking_for_recs_re_anxiety_panic_disorder_adhdpi/,7,"Hi all! So, I became interested in tDCS a few years back when I bought a Cefaly device for my migraines, discovered it did jack shit for my migraines, but it made me want to fall asleep. I was fascinated and began googling to see why that was happening, and that’s when I discovered tDCS is a thing. 

Now that I’ve finally got a few bucks, I’m considering getting one. I’m only in my early stages of researching, but I was reading about how some units/settings aren’t particularly good for panic disorder so I’m very leery. Does anyone else here have panic disorder? Fwiw, mine is very controlled (with a hefty dose of Zoloft) but I definitely have breakthrough anxiety and some mild depression as well (seasonal, and menstrual-cycle-related). 

I’m also at wit’s end with attention issues. My ADHD-PI diagnosis is provisional (I.e., from two therapists who had me take questionnaires; I never did full neuropsych testing in part because I can’t take stims OR strattera due to an underlying health issue). I rely on coping methods alone and it’s just not enough these days. 

Would anyone happen to have specific recommendations for devices/settings? Especially if you have panic disorder AND attention problems?

I was and still am thinking about whether tDCS or neurofeedback would be better for me. 

At the center, the neuropsychologists swear by this tDCS and told me it is their most reliable method for getting results. They said my brainfog can almost fully disappear and my focus would probably get better and my thoughts would feel more organized.
I asked about neurofeedback, and while they do it, they didn't seem quite enthusiastic about it while i have seen multiple times that people swear by neurofeedback for add. The treatment for tDCS costs me 80 euros per session, so all together the whole treatment would be over 1200 euros. So far I have undergone one session - tomorrow is my next. 

Anyway, my question is : What would you guys advise to paying this much money for tDCS or is it something I could do myself at home with a device?

Do tACS and/or tDCS improve working memory?,7,mn9ba3,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/mn9ba3/do_tacs_andor_tdcs_improve_working_memory/,15,"I just shelled out a few hundred dollars for a neuron queen before reading the related studies. I just have a problem with ranking, I guess.
After browsing through some of the published studies, I must admit the potential for positive effects from tACS are questionable, at best. For example, tACS was used to study lexical-semantic retrieval during the performance of automatic and controlled retrieval tasks by subjects. The study methodology is described here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6881370/.

The authors showed that while ""θ-tACS significantly modulated [the] retrieval performance ..., its effects were both task- and phase-specific: the in-phase tACS impaired controlled retrieval, whereas the anti-phase tACS improved controlled but impaired automatic retrieval."" It seems to me that automatic retrieval was more closely associated with moments of Eureka!, as this study appears to suggest (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6453961/). Controlled retrieval is somewhat attenuated while automatic retrieval is what can make a difference in cognitive functioning.

Yet one study demonstrated the absence of any significant effects of either tDCS or tACS on associated memory performance (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090128/), although tACS might be more effective, and another suggests disruptions in working memory performance (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4858529/). Of course, these studies investigate tACS across a wide range of frequencies, from theta through gamma (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29375347/), and the conclusions vary widely like the very oscillations in the studies. There are other studies investigating comparative themes, but they are too numerous to list here. Interested readers can find them on the NIH website!

I was also unable to locate any meta-analyses which could reveal findings of significant effect sizes. One study that actually made me cringe (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6681583/) carried the slight hint that people in my age group could develop impaired motor consolidation from tACS. Ouch!

As zanderman12 faithfully stated, ""we don't know enough yet"". Therein lies the crux of the matter. While there is wide speculation about the general safety of these devices, there are also subtle suggestions sprinkled across the studies about potential dissonance effects from their uninformed application. In fact, I researched the literature because gi67 in another thread strongly called for interested users to read the original studies. My investment at this point is a sunk cost, but if I had read the studies before taking action, I would have made a different decision. So, buyer beware!",1617941635.0,2021-04-09 00:13:55

Wouldn't it be better to have something like an EEG cap and some kind of algorithmic device that detected activity and then mirrored and enhanced said activity?

Noninvasive Brain Stimulation Rescues Cocaine-Induced Prefrontal Hypoactivity and Restores Flexible Behavior,19,m2recu,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/m2recu/noninvasive_brain_stimulation_rescues/,0,">**Background:** To obtain desirable goals, individuals must predict the outcome of specific choices, use that information to direct appropriate actions, and adjust behavior accordingly in changing environments (behavioral flexibility). Substance use disorders are marked by impairments in behavioral flexibility along with decreased prefrontal cortical function that limits the efficacy of treatment strategies. Restoring prefrontal hypoactivity, ideally in a noninvasive manner, is an intriguing target for improving flexible behavior and treatment outcomes.  
>  
>**Methods:** A behavioral flexibility task was used in Long-Evans male rats (n = 97) in conjunction with electrophysiology, optogenetics, and a novel rat model of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to examine the prelimbic cortex (PrL) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) core circuit in behavioral flexibility and determine whether tACS can restore cocaine-induced neural and cognitive dysfunction.  
>  
>**Results:** Optogenetic inactivation revealed that the PrL-NAc core circuit is necessary for the ability to learn strategies to flexibly shift behavior. Cocaine self-administration history caused aberrant PrL-NAc core neural encoding and deficits in flexibility. Optogenetics that selectively activated the PrL-NAc core pathway prior to learning rescued cocaine-induced cognitive flexibility deficits. Remarkably, tACS prior to learning the task reestablished adaptive signaling in the PrL-NAc circuit and restored flexible behavior in a relatively noninvasive and frequency-specific manner.  
>  
>**Conclusions:** We establish a role of NAc core-projecting PrL neurons in behavioral flexibility and provide a novel noninvasive brain stimulation method in rats to rescue cocaine-induced frontal hypofunction and restore flexible behavior, supporting a role of tACS as a therapeutic to treat cognitive deficits in substance use disorders.

Found some articles & trials advocating the use of tDCS & CES for anxiety/OCD but I still need someone to confirm:

&#x200B;

* **CES:**

*""Dr Lesley Parkinson, a clinical psychologist specialising in neuropsycho-physiology who is a spokesperson for Alpha-Stim, explains how the device can help an anxiety disorder as severe as OCD: ""The repetitive compulsive behaviours and cognitions of OCD are initially aimed at reducing anxiety – these can include excess washing, cleaning and checking rituals. The behaviour and thoughts are recognised by the individual as being irrational, so in other words, they have insight. What the Alpha-Stim can do is regulate imbalances within the central nervous-system function – this leads to a reduction in anxiety levels and a calming of neuronal activity, so that the intrusive thoughts and urges for compulsive behaviours are reduced.""* Source: [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/coping-ocd-how-alpha-stim-helping-beat-bully-9948771.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/coping-ocd-how-alpha-stim-helping-beat-bully-9948771.html)

""*SYMPTOM REDUCTION:* *Research studies and clinical experience suggest the many benefits of CES include reduction of the following symptom patterns: depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, insomnia, substance use disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), cognitive dysfunction, traumatic brain injury, and decrease in assaultive behavior.""* Source: [https://bhakticlinic.com/neurofeedback/cranial-electrical-stimulation/](https://bhakticlinic.com/neurofeedback/cranial-electrical-stimulation/)

* **tDCS:**

*""At the end of the study, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the mean Y-BOCS scores of those patients who underwent cathodal tDCS. No pre-post difference was found in the scores of patients following anodal tDCS. Conclusions: Cathodal but not anodal tDCS over the pre-SMA significantly improved OCD symptoms.""* Source: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309609596\_Transcranial\_direct\_current\_stimulation\_for\_obsessive-compulsive\_disorder\_A\_randomized\_controlled\_partial\_crossover\_trial](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309609596_Transcranial_direct_current_stimulation_for_obsessive-compulsive_disorder_A_randomized_controlled_partial_crossover_trial)

Basically, I've done two 30 minute tDCS sessions with the Flow Neuroscience tDCS kit. I decided to try it out for a number of reasons - I have anhedonia and lack of motivation, and also some other conditions (OCD, anxiety, some quasi-akathisia, visual snow) many of which are iatrogenic in nature (SSRI withdrawal, and past alcohol usage certainly didn't help) which I'd hoped could also improve with treatment.

Two days ago I did my first session and experienced an increase in physiological anxiety, but this was tolerable. But then after doing the 30 minute session last night, I experienced an intense feeling of panic, fear and restlessness, coupled with a significant increase in my OCD thoughts and the feeling that I might 'lose control'. This persisted through the night and it's still here just now, albeit slightly better than it was. 

Has anyone experienced similar reactions to this treatment and is this reaction a sign I should stop it?",1613825441.0,2021-02-20 07:50:41

Caputron ActivaDose II Issue and Question,0,lc50r0,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/lc50r0/caputron_activadose_ii_issue_and_question/,2,"So I’m not sure if this is the right sub to ask this question but I figured someone might be able to offer some advice. 

I purchased the ActivaDose II by Caputron not that long ago (2months?) 

I’ve only tested out two montage positions that I found on the totaltdcs website. 

- The “Depression and Anxiety” montage where the anode is placed on the left DLPFC (F3) and cathode on right supraorbital (FP2)

- The “DARPA” montage where the anode is placed on right temple and cathode place on left should/forearm

I have used the former much more than the latter as I really haven’t seen much benefit from the DARPA montage. 

Anyway, this device is suppose to be able to support up to 4.0 mA which it did in the beginning. I personally found 4.0 mA to be too uncomfortable as it had a itchy burning sensation. 

My dose experiments where 1.5/2.0/2.5/3.0/3.5 mA when using the Depression and Anxiety montage. 

I’ve noticed some benefits - namely a sense of calm and relaxation - although oddly that was more noticeable with the DARPA montage. 

Well here is the problem I have encountered - all of sudden the device no longer can go above 2.5 mA; if I attempt to have it go to 2.6mA+ a noticeable electrical current pulses and the devices safety mechanism shuts it down. 

It’s annoying but atleast I am still able to use it and honestly I don’t know if there is actually any benefit from using high mA. But does anyone know what could be causing this? I have a feeling it’s related to the battery but I honestly have no clue. 

My other question is a little different - for those that aren’t familiar with this device it’s electrodes are these neat sponge inserts that require saline solution. I originally purchased the 3x3 one because I thought that might be easier since I was a novice with this technology. 

Having had ECT before I remember that my doctors used these adhesive gel electrodes - I don’t know much about the difference between the electrode types but I believe I have read they are much more accurate in terms of precise location and current dosage. 

Now I’m obviously not trying to do at home ECT - but my question for this community is whether it’s possible to use similar electrodes with my device in lieu of the sponge/saline ones that comes standard? If it is possible does anyone have a source to get medical grade gel adhesive electrodes?",1612405152.0,2021-02-03 21:19:12

Holy shit it works,38,l4ad46,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/l4ad46/holy_shit_it_works/,30,"Hey all, I just got an Activadose today. For the last week I've been monitoring my brainwave activity during various activities using an EEG headband called Flowtime. (Very interesting, detailed feedback, would highly recommend.) I'm ADD, and one thing researchers have found is that ADD and ADHD folks have an excess of Theta brainwaves, which are normally reserved for very relaxed, daydreamy meditative states. Sure enough my Flowtime headband reflects this frustratingly consistently. My Theta waves rival my Beta waves (dominant waking waves in normal people) almost all the time and sometimes even surpass them. The one and only thing that's been able to consistently bring my Beta and Gamma above my Theta are long stretches of time playing really intense video games where my focus is demanded.

Today I tried TDCS for the first time using the DARPA montage for ADHD and attention at 2mA for 20min. After my session was over I measured my brainwaves again. Beta steadily climbed WAY above Theta for a good 15min afterward even though I was doing literally nothing. Even got my Gamma above Theta a bit. Theta also kept falling during the same time. 

I don't consciously feel any different, but holy shit. Unless there's just some residual static left over in my skin throwing off the EEG and giving me false results, it seems like TDCS actually worked? And even kept improving after the session was over?

Montages for anomic aphasia?,3,kf961g,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/kf961g/montages_for_anomic_aphasia/,0,"Hi,

I'm looking for tDCS montages suitable for treating anomic aphasia. I've read a ton of research about the use of tDCS in aphasia and the studies seem to agree that tDCS is a suitable treatment option for it (though needs more research).

However, there are many forms of aphasia that stem from damage to different parts of the brain. Anomic aphasia is thought to be caused by damage to the Broca's area in the left frontotempolar area.

Some of the research says to excite and some say to inhibit this specific region. Others go for more experimental approaches.

[https://sci-hub.se/http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jnnp.2007.135277](https://sci-hub.se/http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jnnp.2007.135277)

For example, this study found some success in inhibiting the region, but the paper doesn't specify the cathode/anode placement.

So this is where I come to you. What would you suggest the placement to be?

Also I'd love to hear if anyone here has successfully improved their aphasia via tDCS.",1608248267.0,2020-12-17 18:37:47

Anyways none of that is relevant to my questions lol.

Have any of you had problems with the earclips, and what did you do to solve them? I don’t really feel the tapping sensation like I guess I am supposed to, and when I do feel it, it’s only on one ear. I know it’s working though, because anything higher than level 1 and I feel seasick (is there an acclimation period or will I just always have to use this thing at the lowest level? 20 minutes is a lot easier of an ask as a daily habit). The bigger issue is just that I have fairly small earlobes and I am CONSTANTLY readjusting the clips. Is there another place I can put the clips? Do the electrodes they sell on their website also work for anxiety and depression? And how reusable are those, because they are not cheap.

In January 2020 I bought the Brain Driver model TBDv2.1 because it seemed better on paper.  It worked well at the 2 mA setting until about September, 2020, and then I stopped feeling the tingling I used to when I started the unit, but the screen indicate that the unit was working. I wrote to Brain Driver and they suggested that I buy new sponges and electrodes. Instead I bought an ActivaDoseII to use as a tDCS unit on September 7, 2020. It work at first, and the screen indicates that it is working, but about a couple of weeks ago, I did not feel the tingling I use to when starting it up.

## A few days ago I bought a Woods AMMW1 Analog Multimeter (cost about $16 at Lowe's) and tested the level of milliamps that each of the above three units put out. The only Brain Stimulator, Travel Model that was 5 years old was delivering 2 mA when measured with the Woods AMMW1 Analog Multimeter. The other two units did not have any measurable output. I measured all the units with and without the sponges. I measure the units at the leads to the electrodes. Only the Brain Stimulator, Travel Model that was 5 years old showed 2 mA in all measurements. The other two units did not show any measurable output.

## In summary, only The Brain Stimulator, Travel Model still gives me a tingling sensation on start-up and measured 2 mA in all measurements. The Brain Driver model TBDv2.1 and ActivaDoseII does not give me any tingling sensation or have any measurable output when set on 2 mA.  These last two units are less than a year old.  I do not think you can buy The Brain Stimulator Travel Model any more since it is 5 years old, but I am now using it on nearly a daily basis.",1606024175.0,2020-11-22 00:49:35

I believe I have ADD from lead poisoning.

tDCS for anxiety and depression 1 week.,22,jom93g,tDCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/jom93g/tdcs_for_anxiety_and_depression_1_week/,13,"I've had problems with depression and anxiety/ptsd since I was a teenager.  Been on at least 9 different medications over my 40 year life so far, with periods of no medication at all.  It's been a rough shitty rollercoaster ride that I've wanted to end many times.

I've previously completed a full 36 session course of rTMS.  it worked well for me while I was getting the treatments.  After about a week or so, I felt spectacular.  It was like my soul was existing in a new brain and body.  Unfortunately, I backslid near the end of the course and continued on a downward trajectory in the following months in terms of anxity/depression symptoms.  Definitely better off than before, but not where I wanted to be.  A second course is an option, but the out of pocket copay cost is pretty high for me, and there's a strong possibility I'll be laid off or change jobs soon.  I need to be saving right now due to all the uncertainty.

I researched tDCS extensively, many of the concepts/unknowns are similar to rTMS, so I decided to give it a shot.   I purchased a higher end unit (though I know it's 15 bucks worth of electrical parts and I'm a electronics hobbyist, I wanted something that ""just worked"" out of the box"").

I'm on day 8.

I've been using the common anxiety/depression montage.  2ma for 20min.  No effects after day 1-2.  A bit of apprehension with the slight warm/burning sensation, and occasional white flashes in my right eye, along with the weird occassional muscle twitching.  It's not comfortable but not uncomfortable (nowhere near rTMS levels at least).  Day 3 felt something of a stimulating effect which has persisted until now.  Days 5-6 both the stimulating effect and I feel like my mood has improved slightly.  I haven't had the similar ""wake up pain"" and angst that some depressed people describe, same effect with the rTMS.  No changes to diet or routine, though I took a benadryl on nights 6 and 7 as allergies are getting bad.  I don't have the wild dreams or fatigue like I did with rTMS.  A slight increase in appetite which was also present with rTMS.  I do the dose around 4pm, and have found my evenings to be more productive.

8 days isn't much, but I feel there are some changes happening.  Too little time to really make a recommendation or qualify this as working, but these are my results so far.

I'll make an update in a week.

Edit: Day 1 I took 1ma for 20 min, day 2 was 1.5ma for 20 min.  Subsequently 2ma.",1604595196.0,2020-11-05 11:53:16
